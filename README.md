# North-east Koster

In the beautiful archipelago of Bohuslän the picturesque North-east Koster can be found. With sprawling nature and wildlife above and below the sea it makes the perfect retreat from the bustling city-life. 

# Moster Dagnys

20 feet from the shore a small white-blue cottage can be found. Moster Dagnys has remained the same since it was built nearly a century ago, despite the modernization of surrounding buildings. Dive in to the deep blue sea or ride it on a jet ski, walk around the island on car free roads and breathe the salty breeze. 

# Instructions

If your project requires some installation or similar, please inform your user 'bout it. For instance, if you want a more decent indentation of your .php files, you could edit [.editorconfig]('/.editorconfig').
